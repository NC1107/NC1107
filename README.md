## About
Software developer passionate about programming, problem-solving, and continuous learning. I enjoy self-hosting and automation, and I explore graphics and systems programming in Rust. I like building useful things, keeping them simple, organized, and reliable while still being scalable. My latest hobby involves managing a homelab and misc. services to avoid paying for 30 different subscriptions. I also enjoy rock climbing, pool, and Advent of Code.
