# Nicholas Conn

Software developer passionate about programming, problem-solving, and continuous learning. I enjoy self-hosting and automation, and I explore graphics and systems programming in Rust. Recently, my professional work has centered on cloud migration with AWS and Terraform.

## About
I run a small homelab and self-host a few services. I like building useful things, keeping them simple, organized, and reliable while still being scalable. I enjoy rock climbing, pool, and Advent of Code.
